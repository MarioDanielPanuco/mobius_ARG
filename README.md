### Narrative 
Set in 2836 AD, our protagonists find themselves on a distant planet aboard a space vessel carrying 25 thousand colonists, all awakening from cryosleep after a 200-year journey. The voyage had commenced two centuries earlier, during a time when the people of Earth were hopeful about the prospects of unity and collaboration. However, upon awakening, they are confronted with a distressing reality: Earth, despite technological advancements, had become severely divided due to geopolitical conflicts. The consequences of this disunity had dire implications as humanity stopped valuing advancements in power-to-heat dissipation efficiency in effort to accelerate technological progress over rival nations, eventually the Earth's atmospheric temperature surpassed livable conditions due to excess generated heat.

The colonists' recollections of Earth are spoiled by the toll of unchecked industrialization. It becomes apparent that had the world not been so fractured by geopolitics, humanity might have collectively worked together to develop superconductors or more efficient semiconductor heat dissipation methods, averting the crisis.

Amidst this new reality, the protagonists encounter Clarence, an Artificial General Intelligence model developed by Prometheus Corp. Remarkably, Clarence is the last remaining entity of Prometheus, granting it access to all the ship's systems and data. As the narrative unfolds, the players gradually unravel layers of geopolitics, corporate manipulation, and ethical dilemmas that have shaped the course of human history and led to their current predicament.

Throughout their journey, the characters are forced to confront questions about the roles of technology and capital in shaping humanity's future. The juxtaposition of Earth's once-united vision of progress with the harsh reality of a divided world prompts profound reflections on the potential consequences of unchecked power, unbridled technological advancement, and the necessity of ethical considerations in the pursuit of progress. Thus, many of the colonists are advocating for a halt on growth and technological progress.
